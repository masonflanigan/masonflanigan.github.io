			<h1>Hawk-thon Co-chair</h1>
				<p> This artifact is special to me because it really showed what being a student leader was really about. It took a losing a lot of sleep, tons of stress, skipping classes left and right, a signifigant drop in amount of homework I could get done, and to top it all off spending over 24 hours at school. Co-chairing this event was definetly worth it when we raised over $16,000 to help four children who were suffering from horrible medical problems. There was one day I will never forget, the summer following the event I went to my brothers baseball game one, one of the children we sponsored was sitting with his mother watching a relative of theirs play for the other team. Both of them just looked happy just being there. After all of this I felt touched enough by this experiance to chair the event again in 2018. </p>

			<h1>Rotary Youth Leadership Awards</h1>
			<p> Rotary Youth Leadership Awards (or RYLA for short) is a week-long leadership conference sponsored by local Rotary Clubs. The RYLA camp I was invited to consisted of 116 high school seniors (3 from AHS)from North Western Pennsylvania.Each recipient of the invitation to the camp who actually attends recieves a $80,000 scholarship to Westminster college.My RYLA experience taught me how to establish myself as a leader in the community and how to get out of my comfort zone to accomplish great things in life. Thanks to this camp I now have many new friends throughout the state, some of which got into foreign exchange programs and are studying abroad and sharing their experiences with us back at home.I feel that this once in a lifetime experience will help me improve the succsess of the 2018 Hawk-Thon event.
